  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I installed dotConnect for Oracle trial, then I have bought and
      installed purchased version, but something went wrong.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Make sure you had uninstalled the trial version correctly.
      There should be no old (trial) assemblies present in your system. Uninstall
      dotConnect for Oracle and check your Global Assembly Cache and local folders for
      Devart.* assemblies. Remove all Devart.* files and reinstall
      dotConnect for Oracle.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade to a newer version of dotConnect for Oracle?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Close all running IDEs and help collections, then run the installation package of the newer version. 
    You will be prompted to uninstall the previous version; agree and then proceed to installing the newer build.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">You say, there are sample projects, but I can't find any.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you installed dotConnect for Oracle not in full mode. Please choose
    <b>full</b> when installing the product. All samples are installed by default in
    <i>\Program Files\dotConnect\Oracle\Samples</i> folder.</span>

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How do I upgrade my projects from dotConnect for Oracle 4.xx?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>
    In the 5.0 release there were some important name changes in the product.
Particularly, assemblies, namespaces, invariant name, and some types
were changed as follows:<br>

<i>"CoreLab.Data"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data";</i><br>
<i>"CoreLab.Oracle"</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.Oracle";</i><br>
<i>"OracleDirectFactory"</i> became <i>"OracleProviderFactory";</i><br>
<i>Invariant name</i> became <i>"Devart.Data.Oracle";</i></p>

<p>Your projects must be updated to be compatible with dotConnect for Oracle 5.0. Here is the list of files you should update:<br>
<i>*.csproj, *.vbproj</i> - references to assemblies<br>
<i>*.cs, *.vb</i> - namespaces<br>
<i>*.licx</i> - namespaces and assembly names<br>
<i>Web.config</i> - assembly names and web provider types</p>
<p>
This is done automatically when you invoke the Upgrade wizard from Visual Studio menu: <i>Tools | Oracle | Upgrade Wizard</i>.
    </p>
  </span>
  </li>

    <li>
        <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have received a message that Devart.Data is incompatible...</span><br>
  <span class="A">
<p>Devart data providers use a common assembly (Devart.Data.dll), so it is necessary to install compatible providers versions. We release our ADO.NET data providers in a single pack, thus releases from the same date should be compatible. Also, Devart data providers should warn you before installation if an incompatible version of Devart.Data.dll was detected.</p>

  <span class="A">
<p>You should put the <i>Devart.Data</i>, <i>Devart.Data.Oracle</i>, and <i>Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.EF<b>&lt;Version&gt;</b></i>
			assemblies in the Bin folder of your application (or place these assemblies in Global
			Assembly Cache). The <b>&lt;Version&gt;</b> here is the version of Entity Framework used 
			in your application. For Entity Framework v1 the assembly is called 
			Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.EF1.dll, for Entity Framework v4 it is 
			Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.EF4.dll, for Entity Framework v5 or v6 it is 
			Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.EF5.dll or Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.EF6.dll respectively.

  <li>
  <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have a registered version of dotConnect for Oracle. Will I need to pay to upgrade to future versions?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
    <p>Since dotConnect for Oracle 4.00, all upgrades to future versions are free for users with an active dotConnect for Oracle Subscription.</p>
    <p>Users that have a registration for versions of dotConnect for Oracle prior to OraDirect .NET 4.00 can upgrade to

  <li>
   <span id="Qx" class="Q">What are the benefits of the dotConnect for Oracle Subscription Program?</span><br>
  <span class="A">
  <p><a name="subscriptionprogram"></a>The <b>dotConnect for Oracle Subscription Program</b> is an annual maintenance and support service
          for dotConnect for Oracle users.</p>
  <p>Users with a valid dotConnect for Oracle Subscription get the following benefits:</p>

  </li>
  </ol>


<span id="Category">Technical Licensing</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What is the licensing you use?</span><br>
    <span class="A">dotConnect for Oracle uses .NET component licensing. To build operational
      application dotConnect for Oracle requires valid license. If no license is available,
      dotConnect for Oracle does not work.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to embed license into my application?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Usually you do not have to care about embedding license in your application.
      When you install dotConnect for Oracle the system is configured so that licensing is done
      transparently. License is automatically added to project when you place a OracleConnection
      component onto a form.<br />
      In some cases you have to manually add license. It is necessary for console applications,
      class libraries, some ASP.NET applications and
      existing projects initially built with dotConnect for Oracle version that did not use component
      licensing, that is, 3.20 and older. For instructions on how to add license manually refer to
      <script>
      if (RunningInHost()) {
        document.write("<a href='Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");
      } else {
        document.write("<a href='http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/docs/?Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening connection I get an exception saying "License not found...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This generally indicates that license information could not be found, or you try to
      apply it in some way that does not suit the kind of application. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>File <i>licenses.licx</i>, required for dotConnect for Oracle to function properly, could not be found.</li>
        <li>File <i>licenses.licx</i> is not added as embedded resource.</li>
        <li>File <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> not found in ASP.NET applications.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To fix the problem determine type of your application and read corresponding section of "<script>
      if (RunningInHost()) {
        document.write("<a href='Licensing.html'>Licensing</a>");
      } else {

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">On opening connection I get an exception saying "License not valid...". What should I do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>This means that license information was found but it is incorrect. It usually happens in the following cases:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The project was earlier compiled with old or trial version of dotConnect for Oracle. </li>
        <li>File <i>licenses.config</i> used by a class library does not refer to launched executable.</li>
        <li>The <i>App_Licenses.dll</i> belongs to other application or needs to be recompiled.</li>
        <li>Something's wrong with the operating system or installation of dotConnect for Oracle.</li>

      to say "Sorry, your trial period has expired". But I do not use trial version any more.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you compiled the application with Trial edition of dotConnect for Oracle,
      and deployed it with assemblies from non-trial version. In this case time limit is actual
      as well. To eliminate the problem just recompile the project.</span>

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to license ASP.NET applications?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      <p>To support server-side compilation you ought to have special assembly <b>App_Licenses.dll</b>
      in the <b>Bin</b> directory of your site. To create this assembly execute <b>Build
      Runtime Licenses</b> command in the licenses.licx file context menu in the <b>Solution
      Explorer</b> view. Required assembly will be created automatically.</p>

      <p>Note that this is not necessary for precompiled ASP.NET applications (if nothing is
      compiled on server by user request). Precompiled applications are licensed as usual applications.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
<span id="Qx" class="Q">I am having problems with the licensing in my project... What am I to do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
    <p>If any problems with licensing occurred in your project, you should use the License Information dialog to resolve them. You can access it from the Visual Studio menu: <i>Tools | Oracle | License Information</i>.</p>
    </span>
  </li>

<span id="Category">Connection pooling</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I call OracleConnection.Open(), then Close(). Physical connection is still
      visible by server. Isn't it a bug?</span><br>
    <span class="A">No, it is not. This is Connection Pooling feature. Actual connection is not closed in
      order to be used later by your application. This boosts performance greatly.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get exception "Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed..."
      What to do?</span><br>
    <span class="A">The full text of the exception is "Timeout expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to
      obtaining a connection from the pool. This may have occurred because all pooled connections were in
      use and max pool size was reached." It clearly states that you have run out of connections available.
      To solve the problem increase <i>Max Pool Size</i> connection string parameter value. The default
      value is 100. Another way to get extra connections is to clear one or all of the pools. Or you can
      turn connection pooling off using <i>Pooling</i> connection string parameter.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to prevent possible pooling problems?</span><br>
    <span class="A">You can clear the pool explicitly. Generally pool is cleared automatically
      when connections are idle or closed by server. To force the operation call ClearPool or
      ClearAllPools methods. Another solution is to disable the pool at all (set <i>Pooling=false</i>
      in connection string). If this does not help, the problem is not caused by pooling.</span>

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">How to open documentation on dotConnect for Oracle?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      There are several ways to open dotConnect for Oracle documentation:
      <ul>
        <li>Use appropriate shortcut in start menu, for instance,
            <i>Start - Programs - Devart dotConnect for Oracle - Documentation</i>.
        <li>Use command in the IDE: <i>Tools - Oracle - dotConnect for Oracle Help</i>.
        <li>Position cursor on some class from Devart.Data.Oracle and press F1.
      </ul>
      There is also same documentation in chm format. You can download it from our site at the following address:
      <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/dcoracle.chm">www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/dcoracle.chm</a>
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I can't see the documentation in Visual Studio Help Collection.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Correctly installed documentation appears as separate node in combined collection
      of Visual Studio and Delphi. If you can't find <b>dotConnect for Oracle</b> node
      there it is because you enabled topics filtering. To reveal the node set filter to <i>"Devart
      Documentation"</i>, or <i>"(unfiltered)"</i>, or <i>"Visual C#"</i> etc.<br>
      Another possible reason is that you installed some IDE after installation of dotConnect for Oracle.
      In this case use aforementioned methods to reach documentation.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">All topics in CHM file are blank.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This can happen due to some patches from Microsoft installed on your system.
      Please read <a href="http://www.devart.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2461">this page</a> to find possible solutions
      for the problem. In most cases it is enough to right-click on the CHM file, select Properties, click on the
      "Unblock" button and click "Apply" to show the contents.

    <span class="A">
      The Professional Edition of dotConnect for Oracle supports both LinqConnect (formerly called LINQ to Oracle) and the
      latest version of ADO.NET Entity Framework.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Where do I start with Entity Framework or LinqConnect?</span><br>

    <span class="A">
      Yes, dotConnect for Oracle includes several Entity Framework and LinqConnect samples in
      C# and Visual Basic. The samples demonstrate how to use several entities
      and a relationship between them. You can also download separate
      <a href="http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/efquerysamples.zip">Entity

  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get concurrency error when modifying records using OracleDataAdapter
      or OracleDataTable. What can be wrong?</span><br>
    <span class="A">
      This can happen when OracleCommandBuilder generates a query without primary key field.
      To avoid it use custom update command instead of generated by OracleCommandBuilder.
      This problem should not take place if primary key field participates in SELECT statement.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">No components can be found in the toolbox.</span><br>
    <span class="A">This can happen if the installation encountered some problems. You can add the
      components to toolbox manually. This procedure is described in the <i>Installation</i> article
      in the documentation. Note that Microsoft Web Developer 2008 Express edition does not allow
      working with toolbox at all.</span>

  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Can I use dotConnect for Oracle assemblies in the x64 process?</span><br>
    <span class="A">dotConnect for Oracle assemblies are built with the /platform:anycpu option. 
    So, you can use provider's assemblies on any platform (x86 or x64). 
    For more information, refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zekwfyz4.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zekwfyz4.aspx</a>.
    The mode of your own assemblies depends on capacity of Oracle Client you are using, and doesn't depend on capacity of your Oracle Server.</span>
  </li> 
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I get an exception "Can not obtain Oracle client information from registry. Make sure that Oracle Client Software is installed, or use Direct mode of connecting to server."</span><br>
    <span class="A">This exception means that your application uses an OCI connection, and either there is no Oracle Client installed on the computer your application is running on or that the Oracle Client and your application have different bitness (x86 or x64). To solve the issue:
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure that Oracle Client is installed on your computer.</li>
			<li>Make sute that Oracle Client has the same bitness as your application. For 32bit application, you must have 32bit Oracle Client installed, and for 64bit application you must have 64bit Oracle Client installed.</li>
			<li>Make sure that the user account, on behalf of which the application is running, has enough privileges to access registry.</li>

<span id="Category">General issues related to Oracle server</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Cannot connect to server on <i>%server name%</i>...</span><br>
    <span class="A">This is actual for mobile edition. Use IP of the server instead of DNS name. It
      is recommended to use internal IP address. For information on how to address target machine
      refer to network administrator.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">What about performance?</span><br>
    <span class="A">We regularly carry out performance tests on different databases with miscellaneous environments.
      The tests show that dotConnect for Oracle is much better than ODBC, OLEDB, and ODP.NET. Besides that
      dotConnect for Oracle has much more features than any data provider, including ODP.NET.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">Non-latin characters in my data are not retrieved correctly.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Use UTF-8 encoding. To enable it, set <i>Connection.Unicode</i> property
      to true or include <i>Unicode=true;</i> in connection string. Keep in mind, however, that this
      affects performance. So it is better to synchronize default client encoding and database objects
      encoding if possible.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I successfully run illegal SQL script that issues CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE...
      Where is my error?</span><br>
    <span class="A">Errors in CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE are considered as warnings in Oracle because
      PACKAGE can be created with errors. You can get information about warnings using
      OracleConnection.InfoMessage event.
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I work with dates and get different results in Direct and OCI modes.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Direct mode does not consider Oracle client settings. The results would be
      identical if you set NLS_LANG='AMERICAN....'  in
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\HOMEn (change AMERICA to you real location)
      or execute statement like this in Direct mode: ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TERRITORY ='AMERICA'
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I can't get or pass data through Array type parameter.</span><br>
    <span class="A">Probably you use wrong type of parameter. Consider the following declarations:
      <br />TYPE PLSQLTableType IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(20) INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
      <br />TYPE NESTEDTABLEType1 IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(20);
      <br />TYPE NESTEDTABLEType2 IS TABLE OF OBJECTTYPE;
      <br />TYPE VARRAYTYPE AS VARRAY(3) OF VARCHAR2(20);<br />
      <br />Use PLSQLTableType with OracleDbType.VarChar and int[] types.
      <br />Use NESTEDTABLEType1 and NESTEDTABLEType2 with OracleDbType.Table and OracleTable types.
      <br />Use VARRAYTYPE with OracleDbType.Array and OracleArray types.

    <span id="Qx" class="Q">I have a stored procedure that returns a "cursor" parameter. What do
      I need to do on client side to retrieve this parameter?</span><br>
    <span class="A">You can use OracleCommand with stored procedure call in conjunction with
      OracleDataAdapter component and fill any DataSet as usual. You can receive OracleCursor
      value from executed OracleCommand and receive OracleDataReader as described below:<br />
      <i>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;OracleParameter p; <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;... <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;OracleDataReader r = ((OracleCursor)p.OracleValue).GetDataReader(); <br />
      </i>
      You can fill DataSet from any OracleCursor object as follows:<br />
      <i>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;DataSet ds = new DataSet(); <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); <br />

I have an Oracle query with nested subqueries. When a column from the outer query is used in the subquery of level 2 and deeper, I get an error "ORA-00904 - Invalid identifier". 
However, the same SQL works perfectly on my Oracle 10.2.0.1 instance. What's going on?
    </span><br>
    <span class="A"><p>This is a known Oracle feature. It does not recognize the fields from the outer query in the subquery. For example, the following query leads to this error:</p>
